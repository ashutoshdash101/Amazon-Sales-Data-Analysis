# Analyzing Amazon Sales Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data to identify trends and uncover insights into sales management. By performing ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) operations on the dataset, we will analyze sales trends and evaluate key metrics to find meaningful relationships between attributes. The project aims to provide actionable insights for improving distribution methods, reducing costs, and increasing profits.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Power BI**: Alternative tool for data visualization.
- **ETL Process**: To clean and transform the dataset for meaningful analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from the repository

## Objectives
1. Perform ETL operations on the Amazon dataset.
2. Analyze sales trends:
   - Month-wise
   - Year-wise
   - Yearly-month-wise
3. Identify and visualize key metrics and their relationships.
4. Present findings using interactive tools and detailed reports.

## Approaches
- **ETL Process**: 
  - Extract: Load the dataset into Python for processing.
  - Transform: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
  - Load: Store the cleaned data for analysis.
- **Analysis Tools**:
  - Python: For in-depth analysis and visualization (using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).
  - Tableau/Power BI: For creating dashboards.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Identify sales patterns over time.
  - Analyze key factors influencing sales performance.
  - Uncover relationships between different attributes.
